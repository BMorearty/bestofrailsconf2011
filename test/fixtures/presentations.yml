  title: Please Don't Come to This Talk
  description_html: I submitted this talk so my resume would look better. I don't actually want anyone to come to the talk because if you do, I'll have to prepare something. And I don't like to prepare. Please, I beg you, just go to another talk. I'm sure there are some really good ones in the same time slot.
